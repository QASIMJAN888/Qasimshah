                        <h3>Education & Background</h3>
<p>
I am a Computer Science graduate from Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, where I developed a strong foundation in technology, programming, and problem-solving. My academic journey was driven by a deep passion for technology and innovation, which motivated me to explore multiple areas of computer science beyond the classroom. Throughout my studies, I gained solid skills in software development, web technologies, and database management, along with a strong understanding of algorithms, data structures, and system design.
</p><p>
During my degree, I honed my web development skills by working extensively with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, later advancing into React JS for building dynamic, interactive user interfaces. I also learned to adapt quickly to emerging tools and frameworks, a skill that continues to help me stay up to date in the ever-evolving tech industry.
</p><p>
In addition to my academic background, I have over three years of professional experience in the healthcare sector as a Medical Billing Specialist. This role has strengthened my analytical thinking, attention to detail, and ability to work under pressure while managing complex billing processes. My unique combination of technical expertise and industry experience allows me to bridge the gap between technology and business operations, making me a versatile and results-oriented professional.                        <p>
